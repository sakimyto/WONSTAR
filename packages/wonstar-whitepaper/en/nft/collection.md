# As an art collection

WONSTAR NFT has value in not only function as game data but also as an art collection.

## Created by multiple great creators

WONSTAR's design art is created by several wonderful creators.

In the actual production flow, first, we created setting materials assuming that WONSTAR is actually alive in the metaverse world such as races and attributes, WONSTAR lifestyles. After that, each creator will be in charge of WONSTAR where they can make the most of their own characteristics.

Based on the same view of the world, multiple creators are in charge of illustrations, creating an attractive WONSTAR.

## WONSTAR body uses the design as it is

As mentioned above, WONSTAR NFT is particular about each monsterâ€™s design.

Even 100 years later when you see WONSTAR NFT for the first time, we want you to feel the value as an art.

From that idea, the WONSTAR main body uses the designed one as it is. Diversity as an NFT, by expressing things such as backgrounds and items, has both value as game data and value as an art collection.

## PTP (Partner-Picture) rather than PFP (Profile-Picture)

Many of today's collectible NFTs are created as PFPs.
In the current SNS, the PFP has to be changed every time a new NFT is acquired.
We feel that PFPs, which have been used to express individuality, are beginning to make it difficult to recognise individuals, or rather to recognise individuals because of the rapidity with which they change.

The rise of new SNS and the metaverse will change the way we express ourselves and solve this problem.
In such a future, we need NFTs not only as profile avatars, but also as pet partners.
We have created you as a WOSNTAR NFT, a partner who will stay by your side even if you change your PFP. (Of course you can also use it as a PFP and become a WONSTAR yourself!)
