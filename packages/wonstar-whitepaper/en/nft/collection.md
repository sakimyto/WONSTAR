# Plan to split the collection

The NFT will be available in two variants, one for collectors and one for players.

For collectors, a small number of expensive NFTs will be released so that the NFTs have value as art.
For players, a large number of NFTs will be released inexpensively, like replicas for games, so that the NFTs can be played in the game.

Both of these specifications can be used in games to encourage more people to enjoy the games.
