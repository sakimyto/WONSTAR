# As game data

The big difference between WONSTAR NFT and other NFT projects is that it is a combination of art and game design.
We assume that it will be used in battle games, and give NFT immutable and versatile basic status data.

## Multiple monsters of the same race are born instead of just one

In battle games, we think that races need to be limited and recognizable for users.
Frequently NFTs are created as fully original art in full generative form.
Alternatively, GameFi generates multiple NFTs that are similar in appearance, but only as data for the game.

In the early days of the project, we wanted to create generative NFTs or to create NFTs as completely original illustration art, one by one.

However, we realised that a necessary element of an interesting and long-lasting competitive game is that the races must be finite and user-recognisable.

This is because the environment's metacycle functions.

The environment’s metacycle is the transition of usage rate, for example, because A is strong, the usage rate of A goes up → the usage rate of B, which is strong against A, goes up.

We think that this structure is one of the factors guaranteeing the fun of a battle game, so it is designed to generate the same race.

For this reason, the WONSTAR NFT is designed to be a generative NFT by combining parts of the same WONSTAR race, such as backgrounds, so that the races are recognisable.

## Each one has its own unique status potential value

Race data alone cannot differentiate each NFT. Therefore, in WONSTAR NFT, each WONSTAR is randomly assigned a potential attribute.

It is also designed to give you the minimum unit of data you need so that you can use it in creating various secondary creation games.

NOTE: We plan to implement a mechanism to reflect the user's play history in the NFT related data itself.
