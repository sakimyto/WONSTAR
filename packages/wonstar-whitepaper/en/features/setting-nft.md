# NFT in WONSTAR world

In the WONSTAR world, WONSTAR NFT is called "W-CARD".

WONSTARs are creatures that universally exist in the Metaverse. They may live with people or they may live in a completely different metaverse.

What connects the relationship with them is W-CARD.

WONSTAR is not confined in the NFT (W-CARD) you have. By using W-CARD, you can request cooperation from WONSTAR in other places.

WONSTAR who responded to the cooperation will rush to the metaverse point where you are through W-CARD. (Depending on their situation, they may not answer the call.)
