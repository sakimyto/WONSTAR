# About WONSTAR

WONSTAR, using NFT data, is a battle game that you can earn while playing.
We call the mysterious creatures living in Metaverse “WONSTAR” and the people living in Metaverse with them “WOLDER”.
All WONSTARs are designed for the game and have their own status on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Vision & Mission

We wanted to create an interesting game that can be played for a long period. Blockchain technology is great and we believe GameFi will become the de facto standard for games in the future.

When thinking about that future, we think the most important thing for a game is having fun playing it and wanting to play everyday. By linking NFT with status data, game data can be used for a long period of time, and it is possible to create games that are more interesting, furthermore the asset value increases while playing happily. With that conviction, we launched the WONSTAR project to create a global game and content.
